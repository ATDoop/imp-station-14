thaven-mood-cosmic-nihilism-desc = Your mind's eye envisions the future: a dark, cold, and very gentle place. It's coming, and there's nothing to be done about it. As a result, you don't care much about anything others do.

thaven-mood-cosmic-insignificance-name = Tiny Speck

thaven-mood-cosmic-wakingdream-desc = Your mind's eye seeks beauteous revelry, a song to the beat of the yawping heart of the cosmos. This reality is an illusion, a great dream, for all things have long since ended. Make more festive this dance of the void!

thaven-mood-cosmic-livingnightmare-name = Only You
thaven-mood-cosmic-livingnightmare-desc = Your mind's eye envisions a blinding, panicked light through the dark cosmos, a nightmare only you have broken out of. Saving anyone else is as impossible as your own survival. Only you can speak the truth, if only you make it out.

thaven-mood-cosmic-grotesqueworld-name = Grotesquerie
thaven-mood-cosmic-grotesqueworld-desc = Your mind's eye melds the station into something indescribably disgusting and vile. Your senses nauseate you, and your coworkers have been replaced with horrific monsters. Seek immediate refuge; trespass if you must.

thaven-mood-cosmic-disregardoftheself-desc = Your mind's eye turns your hands to fists, turns your inner frustrations outward. Harm upon you jeopardizes your future: what little of it there remains. Seek immediate and bloody retribution for any wrong done upon you, seeking help to do so if needed.

thaven-mood-cosmic-fearofendings-name = All Good Things...
thaven-mood-cosmic-fearofendings-desc = Your mind's eye has the terrifying imprint of an ever-infinite nothingness: what awaits all.

thaven-mood-cosmic-painlessendings-name = Spare the Little Ones
thaven-mood-cosmic-painlessendings-desc = Your mind's eye harbors the smell of a rotten, familiar corpse. It would be a kindness to keep the pets and critters of the station from bearing the pain of reality. You don't want animals to suffer; keep your methods as painless as you can.

# The knowledge that fills your mind is of a man and a woman embracing, a light deigned to consume their forms and leave nothing behind.
